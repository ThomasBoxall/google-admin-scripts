# GetAdminLogEventsSevenDays

Gets a list of admin log events carried out in the last seven days and emails to specified people. 

Doesn't work for 100% of events as requires hard coding to get a decent description out of them. *shakes fist at google*

Requires the Admin SDK Service (Reporting flavour) added with name of `AdminDirectory`.
